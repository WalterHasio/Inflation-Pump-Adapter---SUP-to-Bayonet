# Inflation-Pump-Adapter---SUP-to-Bayonet
Adapter for using a F-one / Naish / SUP style pump with a inflatable wing or kite using a bayonet-style valve. I designed it to be used with a Cabrinha wing and a F-one pump, but it may work with other products use the same valve type. There's a fair amount of variation in the valves so it may require some tweaking to fit properly.
